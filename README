This project is configured to work with Android 2.1

Make sure to not check in your .classpath, or any files in the bin/ directory
To do this easily with git - create a new file named .gitignore in the base project directory.  Add .classpath and bin/ on separate lines in this file, and git will know to ignore these files in subsequent commits.
